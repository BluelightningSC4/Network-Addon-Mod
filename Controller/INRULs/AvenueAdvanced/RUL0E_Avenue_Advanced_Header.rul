;NOTE; file has been modified, has some sections throughout commented out,
; has custom content, & contains various additional rules, done by Simtropolis Modd Squad &/or others.

;NOTE FROM the7trumpets:
;The following sections have been manually rotated and flipped to
;allow this file to be a road rules type file instead of a
;transmogrify file, so that the turning lanes tiles do not get
;incorrectly flipped.
