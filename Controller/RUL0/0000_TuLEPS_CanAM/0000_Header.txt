; Intersection ordering
;
; RotationRing = hex-id [,hex-id...]
;
;   Creates a ring of rules that are cycled through via
;   Home/End or automatically by the tool as it tries to
;   auto-fit rules to the current mouse point.
;
; AddTypes = hex-id [,hex-id...]
;
;   Attaches another ring to the last ring, creating type
;   rings perpendicular to the rotation ring.  Type rings
;   can be cycled through via Tab/Shift-Tab.  Generally,
;   type rings are set up to preserve rotation as you
;   cycle through rules of different network types.
;
; A given rule can only belong to ONE rotation ring and
; ONE type ring.  Attempting to hook a rule into more than
; one rotation or type ring will result in the rings getting
; trashed.

;Additional information added by Tropod 17/04/04.
;For any additional RotationRings, AddTypes, and/or Rules, the following designations should preferrably be followed;
;long version
;Rail Addon Mod 0x00004###
;dirtroad 0x00005###
;street 0x00006###
;road 0x00007###
;onewayroad 0x00008###
;avenue 0x00009###
;rail 0x0000a###
;lightrail 0x0000b###
;monorail 0x0000c###
;groundhighway 0x0000d###
;highway 0x0000e###
;Pedestraian 0x00006###
;Miscellaneous 0x0000f### may contain items that might otherwise normally be nested under network specific section.
;For the short version, just remove 0x0000 from the start of each one.
;These RotationRing & AddTypes values can typically be changed safely for any items. Note though; changing the value of an item will require changing any references pointing to the item.

;Where one network type overpasses another network type, then the number 
;used should preferrably be dictated by which network overlaps/overpasses the other.
;The indexing of the RotationRings,AddTypes, & Rules should prefably be at least 0x10 for <--
;each additional one. This is to allow for some flexibility if changes/additions are made <--  Old guidelines, please see below
; to an item at a later date for whatever reasons.                                        <--
;
;RotationRing lines must all include a unique 4 digit HID and all other entries increment the 5th digit (and 6th, 7th and 8th if necessary)
;AddTypes lines should follow the same guideline to maintain compatability with the DAMN menu system.
;
;
;Notes for Lines;
;ConsLayout works in conjunction with CellLayout based on CheckTypes. Also, ConsLayout influences terrain/model movement with the use of ASCII characters. Some characters though aren't actually valid.
