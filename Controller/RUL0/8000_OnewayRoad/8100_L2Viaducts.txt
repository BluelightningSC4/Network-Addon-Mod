;NOTE; all 0x59######, 0x79###### path files are now reversed through the ini network file. Be sure to include left hand drive paths & change IIDs. This also includes needing left hand drive paths for transposed paths. Transposed=Reversed.

;NOTE; using Transpose function impacts on onewayroad direction for 'check' flags & paths for onewayroad, 
;therefore may need onewaydir fuction to enforce direction for check flags & also additional paths in the case
;of transpose function using autopathbase function for additional paths.
