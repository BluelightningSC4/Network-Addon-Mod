Instructions for compiling metarules
------------------------------------

First, make sure you have installed SBT and a recent version of Java (at least Java 7).
Then, execute `sbt run`
in this directory, which generates proper RUL files and outputs them into the directory `target`.
The generated files can then be copied manually to the `Controller` directory.
